# NEWS -- 2020 Nov. 11

This package is currently not working.

I am looking into updating it for Julia 1.5

However, it seems that all of the functionality in this package can be replicated,
albeit with slightly clunkier syntax,
just using 

    @testset "Example" begin
        for x in [Explicit Cases, Perhaps Constructed Using rand()]
            @test Property(x)
        end
    end




## Old Readme

Automated testing macros
inspired by a [Julia implementation](https://github.com/pao/QuickCheck.jl)
of Koen Claessen and John Hughes' [QuickCheck](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/)
property-based randomized tester.

Checkers lets you write quick property-based tests:

    julia> using Checkers
    julia> f(x) = x^2
    julia> @test_formany -10<x<10, f(x) >= 0
    Test Passed
      Expression: (:((-10 < x < 10, f(x) >= 0)), :(mode = test_formany))

    julia> @test_forall x in -10:10, f(x) >= 0
    Test Passed
      Expression: (x in -10:10, f(x) >= 0)
        @test_forall x in 0:10, f(x) >= 0

    julia> @test_forall x in -10:10, f(x) > 0 #Should fail b/c f(0) = 0
    Test Failed
      Expression: (x in -10:10, f(x) > 0)
    ERROR: There was an error during testing


## Quickstart Guide

This package provides three macros for test generation:

1. `@test_forall`
2. `@test_formany`
3. `@test_exists`

In each case, the basic format is

    @[test] [set of values to test] [property to test]

The *property* is any expression that evaluates to a boolean,
making reference to some dummy variable specified in the set of values
to test.

The macros differ in how they specify and choose values to test:

- Use `@test_forall` when you can specify the exact *finite set* of values to 
  test. 
  For example, `-3:3` specifies the exact set of 7 Int64 values,
  {-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3}, on which you wish to test the property.
  Because the user specifies the test universe completely,
  and that universe is finite,
  every value is tested and @test_forall returns only true positives
  and true negatives.

- Use `@test_formany` when you wish to specify a (possibly infinite) set of values 
  to test by restricted comprehension from some universe. 
  For example, `-3 < x::Float64 < 3` specifies that some number of `Float64`s `x`,
  satisfying the condition `-3 < x < 3`, will be tested for the property.
  Note that `@test_formany` is meant to capture the idea of the universal 
  quantifier, but is not universal on infinite sets, 
  since the package will only run a finite number of tests.
  That is, `@test_formany` may return a false positive, as it cannot
  be comprehensive. It will not, however, return a false negative.

- Use `@test_exists` like `@test_formany`, but when you wish the test to pass when 
  at least one value satisfies the property, rather than when all tested
  values satisfy the property.
  Like `@test_formany`, `@test_exists` *simulates* the existential quantifier,
  but is not strictly speaking complete. 
  That is, `@test_exists` may return a false negative, in the case that
  a value exists but was not lucky enough to be tested.
  It will not, however, return a false positive.

## The Macros in More Detail

`@test_forall` takes an expression specifying one or more dummy variables,
discrete sets of values for those variables, and an expression, and tests the
expression substituting every combination of the variables 
(the Cartesian product of their possible value sets). 
(Since Julia 0.5,
`@test_forall x in [Collection], P(x)` is quite similar to 
`@test for x in [Collection] P(x) end`,
and we may deprecate / remove it for that reason.)

The property may be a conditional expression such as `P(x) --> Q(x)`,
in which case truth may be vacuous when `P(x)` is false `\forall x` tested.

`@test_formany` functions like `@test_forall`, but allows quantifying over
infinite sets such as `[a,b] \subset \mathbb R`, etc. by sampling these
sets uniformly at random. It provides additional modifiers to control
how many tests it runs, which are especially helpful for ensuring
that conditional-expression tests are not only passed vacuously.

`@test_exists X` is essentially shorthand for `! (@test_formany !X)`.

### Exhaustion

Note that `@test_formany` and `@test_exists` are not strictly speaking exhaustive
or true universal/existential quantifiers. `@test_formany x Expr(x)` may pass
even when `\exists x` s.t. `Expr(x)` is false, and `@test_exists x Expr(x)` may
fail even under the same circumstances. However, `@test_forall` is exhaustive.

Tests that do not exhaust their universe take additional keyword arguments 
`ntests` and `maxtests` to control how many tests to run.

### Examples

Basic usage:

    @test_forall  x in 1:5,  x^2 < 30
    @test_formany 1 < x < 5, x^2 < 30
    @test_exists  1 < x < 5, x^2 < 30
    
Control how many tests in `@test_formany`:

    @test_formany ntests = 10_000  1 < x < 5, x^2 < 30
    
Test a conditional property, passing only if 100 of the tests are not vacuous:

    @test_formany ntests = 100  0 < x < Inf, 0 < y < Inf,  x < y --> log(x)<log(y)
  
Test a conditional property, passing only if 100 of the tests are not vacuous, but only allow 100 tests:

    @test_formany ntests = 100 maxtests = 100  0 < x < 10,  0 < y < 10,  x < y --> x^2 < y^2
    
Test a conditional property, passing only if 100 of the test are not vacuous, but allow 100,000 tests:

    @test_formany ntests = 100 maxtests = 100_000 0 < x < 10,  0 < y < 10,  x < y --> x^2 < y^2

Note that while the former (`maxtests=100`) usually fails, the latter (`maxtests=100_000`) passes. 
This is because `@test_formany` generates 100 random pairs of `(x,y)`, but not all of them
are likely to satisfy `x < y`. Therefore when `maxtests=100`, it will not generate
enough pairs to test the consequent of the conditional expression.

See `?@test_forall`, etc. and `examples/examples.jl` for more detailed information. 

### Logging

Test logging is available in `@test_formany` to see which values were actually tested
by using the keyword `logto` and supplying an output path:

    @test_formany logto = "tests.csv" 1<x<5, x^2 < 30

### Output

Test macros output results of type `Base.Test.Pass`, `Base.Test.Fail`, 
or `Base.Test.Error` in order to function seamlessly with `Base.Test.@testset`.

    @testset "Multiple tests" begin 
        @test_forall x in 1:5, x^2 < 30
        @test_forall x in 1:6, x^2 < 30
    end

Also of note are these more comprehensive (and we feel complicated) packages. 
Our goal is to provide a lightweight, ready-to-use out-of-the-box alternative:
